# Resident Service Interface

This project simulates a simplified interface for a local service technician for different types of repairs. It's built using HTML, CSS (with Bootstrap 5), and JavaScript. The application tracks repair calls, displays required tools, and visually represents the technician's status (incoming call, picking up tools, going to/returning from a job).
